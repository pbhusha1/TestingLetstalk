# TechStack: XCode, SwiftUI

# Workflow:

The users create their profile on the application, filling their basic details, selecting their communication and conversation preferences details, and answering personality questions, and setting up their credentials to login every time.
Users can select the type of membership (right now only one membership level)  they want to avail at the time of registration, or can come back anytime to purchase the membership through the payment gateway provided.
Then the user logs in to the application with their credentials.
The users will be matched based on the categories they selected.
After logging in, the user selects the category on which he/she wants to start a conversation.
And based on the matching, the user will select another person to communicate with.
After they both agree to start a conversation mutually agreeing on the mode of conversation (a pop-up window will appear asking them to select their mode of chat which are text, call, video ( a user can select multiple modes)).
Users can then start the conversation based on their decided chat modes.
